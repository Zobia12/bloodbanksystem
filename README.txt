The project is an online system that allows to check weather required blood donors of a particular group are available in the blood bank.
If someone wants to donate, user will click on donate page, for filling form in which donor have to first register adding its credentials 
i.e city, number, blood group, name, email etc.
For blood booking donors phone number and blood group is posted on the donor page to find available donors for a blood emergency. 
This online system is supported by an Sql database to store blood and user specific details.
But we know that after donating blood we are not allowed for donate again within 3 months. So this project have that functionality too,
In which user will be disabled for three moths after donating blood.
In short, this project is all about Blood Bank donation system, which can collect blood from many donators from various sources
 and distribute that blood to needy people who require blood.
